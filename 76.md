NIP-76
======

`REPLACE` command for updating replaceables
-------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines a new message, `REPLACE`, that clients can use to publish _replaceable_ and _addressable_ events to relays.

It works like `EVENT`, but together with the event JSON, the client also sends the id of the event they are replacing.

```jsonc
["REPLACE", "<id-of-event-being-replaced>", "<new-event>"]
```

Upon receiving this message, relays should check if the `<id-of-event-being-replaced>` corresponds to the latest event id they have stored locally that corresponds to the new replaceable event being received.

If it does correspond, it responds with an `OK` normally; otherwise it responds with something I'm not sure but that allows the client to fix its stuff.
